## TableBuilderOptions.height property

Visible height in rows.

**Signature:**

```typescript
height?: number;
```

## Remarks

Controls how many rows are visible at once. The table will scroll if there are more rows. If not specified, defaults to the number of rows.

When explicitly set to 0, the table shows no rows (effectively hidden). This is rarely desired - omit this option to show all rows, or set a positive value to create a scrollable window showing that many rows at once.
