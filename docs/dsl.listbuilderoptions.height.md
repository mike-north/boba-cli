## ListBuilderOptions.height property

Height of the list component in lines.

**Signature:**

```typescript
height?: number;
```

## Remarks

Used to calculate pagination. If not provided, defaults to 0.

When set to 0 (the default), the height is calculated based on the item delegate's height calculations with a default page size. When set to a positive value, pagination is calculated to fit that many lines, creating a scrollable list if items exceed the height.
