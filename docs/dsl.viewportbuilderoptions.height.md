## ViewportBuilderOptions.height property

Viewport height in lines.

**Signature:**

```typescript
height?: number;
```

## Remarks

Defines the vertical size (number of visible lines) of the viewport. Defaults to 0.

When set to 0 (the default), the viewport shows no lines (effectively disabled). Set this to a positive value to create a scrollable window showing that many lines at once. If there are more content lines than the height, the viewport becomes scrollable.
